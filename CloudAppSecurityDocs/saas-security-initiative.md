## What is the SaaS Security Initiative?

The SaaS Security Initiative serves as the main hub for SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), consolidating best-practice recommendations into 12 measurable metrics. These metrics facilitate the management and prioritization of a large number of security recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Your organization must have Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps licenses.
- The app which you wish to see security recommendations for, must be connected.
- For more information, see:

    - [Connect apps to get visibility and control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md)
    - [Learn which of the apps connectors provides security recommendations ](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md#user-app-governance-and-security-configuration-visibility)

## Operational Guidelines
To initiate the process, navigate to the **Exposure Management** blade and select **Initiatives**. Click on the **SaaS Security** initiative and then select **Open Initiative Page**.

On this page, you'll find 12 measurable metrics that categorize hundreds of best practice recommendations. 

It's recommended to prioritize metrics with the highest **Impact on Initiative Score**, which is a composite measure that considers both the **Weight** of each recommendation and the percentage of **Non-Compliant** recommendations. To effectively monitor progress, it's advisable to set a **target score** for your organizationâ€™s security posture. This target will serve as a benchmark for improvement and help track advancements over time.

For instance, to gain visibility into all best practice recommendations pertaining to privileged access within SaaS applications, select the metric labeled **Missing Best Practices to Secure Privileged Access in SaaS Apps**.

Once selected, you can click on any of the **Non-Compliant** recommendations to access the associated remediation steps.

## Additional Information

- Each metric includes a list of associated app connectors, encouraging organizations to enable more connectors for enhanced visibility. If you're interested in recommendations for specific applications, navigate to the **Security Recommendations** tab and filter by the relevant application.
