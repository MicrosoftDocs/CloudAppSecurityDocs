    questions:
      - question: What is app governance?
        answer: |
          App governance is an add-on to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. It provides expanded visibility and control over apps that access your Microsoft 365 data. [Learn more about app governance](app-governance-manage-app-governance.md)
      - question: What types of apps does app governance secure?
        answer: |
          App governance currently tracks non-Microsoft apps that use OAuth to authenticate to Azure Active Directory.

          These apps represent modern apps that can access various resources, including Microsoft 365 data in mailboxes, OneDrive folders, SharePoint sites, and Teams. End users regularly introduce these apps and can give them consent to access data.
          
          While Defender for Cloud Apps also tracks apps that use OAuth to access Microsoft 365, app governance provides additional out-of-box detections and highly customizable policies that track various app attributes and behaviors.
      - question: How can I try app governance?
        answer: |
          Once you have Defender for Cloud Apps, you can get use app governance with a trial license. The trial gives you full access to all app governance features for 90 days. [Learn how to start using app governance](app-governance-get-started.md)
      - question: How can I get the app governance add-on license?
        answer: |
          If you haven't yet, get a trial license to start using app governance. Once the trial expires, you'll need to purchase an add-on license to continue using the service. [Learn how to start using app governance](app-governance-get-started.md) 
      - question: What can app governance detect?
        answer: |
          App governance generates two types of alerts:
          - **Threat detection alerts** are based on Microsoft threat intelligence and are designed to identify apps that are malicious. These out-of-box detections utilize machine learning and anomaly detection to find applications that are likely involved in an attack. [View threat detection alert types](app-governance-anomaly-detection-alerts.md)
          - **Policy alerts** track various app attributes and behaviors—certification, data use, API access errors, unused permissions—that can indicate misuse and risk. The policies themselves are either customizable (user-defined) or predefined:
              - User-defined policies can use one or many conditions to identify risky apps. You can set custom thresholds to determine when these policies are triggered. 
              - Predefined policies track the same app attributes and behaviors, but look into other signals and dynamically adjust thresholds.
      - question: What types of actions can app governance take on cloud apps that trigger policy?
        answer: |
          App governance can deactivate apps that match either user-defined or predefined policies. Deactivated apps aren't able to authenticate to Azure AD and access resources, until they're activated manually. [Learn about app governance policies](app-governance-app-policies-create.md)
      - question: Can I customize my policies?
        answer: |
          You can create policies by combining conditions that track various app attributes and behaviors. When these conditions are met, policies trigger alerts and take the action you've specified. App governance also provides predefined policies that you switch on or off. You can also set the action on predefined policies.

      - question: Is app governance integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender?
        answer: |
           App governance alerts and related incidents are available in the Microsoft 365 Defender queue. Microsoft 365 Defender correlates the alerts with signals from other solutions, such as Defender for Endpoint, to associate related attack activities and identify security incidents. App governance alerts and incidents are also integrated with Microsoft Sentinel.
      - question: What roles do I need to have to use app governance?
        answer: |
          To obtain a trial license or to purchase a license, you need to have the following Azure Active Directory roles:
          -	Billing admin
          -	Global admin

          For full access to app governance, you need to be an **application admin**. **Security operators**, **security admins**, and **compliance admins** also have comprehensive access to app governance. [Read full list of roles and permissions](app-governance-get-started.md#roles)
      - question: Is app governance available in all regions?
        answer: |
          App governance is currently not available in Brazil, South Korea, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa, and United Arab Emirates. To use app governance, your billing location must be in another country/region.

      - question: Why is app governance empty or showing inaccurate data?
        answer: |
          It can take up to 24 hours to fully prepare app governance and retrieve data after you first initiate it. During this period data access statistics and app counts can be inaccurate.

      - question: How does app governance integrate with Microsoft Sentinel?
        answer: |
          App governance is integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender for a unified alert experience. The Microsoft 365 Defender connector for Microsoft Sentinel (preview) sends all Microsoft 365 Defender incidents and alerts information to Microsoft Sentinel and keeps the incidents synchronized.  

          The Microsoft 365 Defender connector enables you to automatically detect, triage, investigate and remediate app governance incidents and alerts on Microsoft Sentinel. For more information see [Microsoft 365 Defender integration with Microsoft Sentinel](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender-integration-with-azure-sentinel) and [Connect data from Microsoft 365 Defender to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/connect-microsoft-365-defender)
