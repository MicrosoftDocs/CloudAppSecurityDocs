# How Cloud App Security helps protect your ServiceNow environment

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

As a major CRM cloud provider, ServiceNow incorporates large amounts of sensitive information about customers, internal processes, incidents, and reports inside your organization. Being a business-critical app, ServiceNow is accessed and used by people inside your organization and by others outside of it (such as partners and contractors) for various purposes. In many cases, a large proportion of your users accessing ServiceNow have low awareness of security and might put your sensitive information at risk by unintentionally sharing it. In other instances, malicious actors may gain access to your most sensitive customer-related assets.

Connecting ServiceNow to Cloud App Security gives you improved insights into your users’ activities, provides threat detection using machine learning based anomaly detections, and information protection detections such as identifying when sensitive customer information is uploaded to the ServiceNow cloud.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats
- Data leakage
- Insufficient security awareness
- Ransomware
- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

- [Discover, classify, label, and protect regulated and sensitive data stored in the cloud](best-practices.md#discover-classify-label-and-protect-regulated-and-sensitive-data-stored-in-the-cloud)
- [Enforce DLP and compliance policies for data stored in the cloud](best-practices.md#enforce-dlp-and-compliance-policies-for-data-stored-in-the-cloud)
- [Limit exposure of shared data and enforce collaboration policies](best-practices.md#limit-exposure-of-shared-data-and-enforce-collaboration-policies)
- [Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations](best-practices.md#use-the-audit-trail-of-activities-for-forensic-investigations)

## Control ServiceNow with built-in policies and policy templates

You can use the following built-in policy templates to detect and notify you about potential threats:

| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| Built-in anomaly detection policy | [Activity from anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)<br />[Activity from infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country)<br />[Activity from suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)<br />[Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)<br />[Activity performed by terminated user](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-performed-by-terminated-user) (requires AAD as IdP)<br />[Multiple failed login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)<br />[Ransomware detection](anomaly-detection-policy.md#ransomware-activity)<br />[Unusual multiple file download activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) |
| Activity policy template | Logon from a risky IP address<br />Mass download by a single user<br />Potential ransomware activity |
| File policy template | Detect a file shared with an unauthorized domain<br />Detect a file shared with personal email addresses<br />Detect files with PII/PCI/PHI |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following ServiceNow governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| Type | Action |
| ---- | ---- |
| User governance | - Notify user on alert (via Azure AD)<br />- Require user to sign in again (via Azure AD)<br />- Suspend user (via Azure AD) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

## Protect ServiceNow in real time

Review our best practices for [securing and collaborating with external users](best-practices.md#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls) and [blocking and protecting the download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices](best-practices.md#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices).
