# Learn about app policies

App governance uses machine learning-based detection algorithms to detect anomalous app behavior in your organization and generates alerts that you can see, investigate, and resolve. Beyond this built-in detection capability, you can use a set of default policy templates or create your own app policies that generate other alerts.

These policies for app and user patterns and behaviors can protect your users from using noncompliant or malicious apps and limit the access of risky apps to your tenant data.
