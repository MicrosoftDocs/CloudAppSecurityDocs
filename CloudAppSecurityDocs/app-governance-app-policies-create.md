# Create app policies

Along with a built-in set of capabilities to detect anomalous app behavior and generate alerts based on machine learning algorithms, app policies in app governance are a way for you to:

- Specify conditions by which app governance can alert you to app behavior for automatic or manual remediation.
- Implement the app compliance policies for your organization.

You can create app policies from provided templates that can be customized, or you can create your own custom app policy.

To create a new app policy, go to **Microsoft 365 Defender > App governance > Overview page > Policies**. Select the **Create New Policy** option:

- To create a new app policy from a template, choose the relevant template category followed by the template in that category.
- To create a custom policy, select the **Custom** category.

## App policy templates

To create a new app policy based on an app policy template, on the **Choose App policy template page**, select a category of app template, select the name of the template, and then select **Next**.

App governance has three categories of app policy templates.

### Usage

App governance includes these templates to generate alerts for app usage.

<br>

****

  |Template name|Description|
  |---|---|
  |New app with high data usage|Find newly registered apps that have uploaded or downloaded large amounts of data. This policy checks the following conditions:<br /><br /><li>Registration age: Seven days or less (customizable)<br /><li>Data access: Greater than 1 GB in one day (customizable)|
  |Increase in users|Find apps with a sizable increase in the number of users. This policy checks the following conditions:<br /><br /> <li> Time range: Last 90 days<br /> <li> Increase in consenting users: At least 50% (customizable)|

### Permissions

App governance includes these templates to generate alerts for app permissions.

<br>

****

|Template name|Description|
|---|---|
|Overprivileged app|Find apps that have unused permissions. These apps have been granted permissions that could be unnecessary for regular use.|
|New highly privileged app|Find newly registered apps that have been granted write access and other powerful permissions. This policy checks the following conditions:<br /><br /><li>Registration age: Seven days or less (customizable)|
|New app with non-Graph API permissions|Find newly registered apps that have permissions to non-Graph APIs. These apps can expose you to risks if the APIs they access receive limited support and updates. <br />This policy checks the following conditions:<br /><br /><li>Registration age: Seven days or less (customizable)<br /><li> Non-Graph API permissions: Yes|

### Certification

App governance includes these templates to generate alerts for Microsoft 365 certification.

<br>

****

|Template name|Description|
|---|---|
|New uncertified app|Find newly registered apps that donâ€™t have publisher attestation or Microsoft 365 certification. This policy checks the following conditions:<br /><br /><li>Registration age: Seven days or less (customizable)<br /><li>Certification: No certification (customizable)|

## Custom

Use a custom app policy when you need to do something not already done by one of the built-in templates.

1. To create a new custom app policy, first select **Create new policy** on the **Policies** page. On the **Choose App policy template page**, select the **Custom** category, the **Custom policy** template, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Name and description** page, configure the following:

    - Policy Name
    - Policy Description
    - Select the policy severity, which sets the severity of alerts generated by this policy.
      - High
      - Medium
      - Low

1. On the **Choose Policy settings and conditions** page, for **Choose which apps this policy is applicable for**, select:

    - All Apps
    - Choose specific apps

1. A pane allows you to select one or more apps.
    Select **Add**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose Policy settings and conditions** page, select **Set new conditions for policy**, and then select **Next**.

1. The **Create rule** pane allows you to select conditions for a new rule. Select **Add condition** and select from the list of conditions, and then specify the value of the condition. You can add multiple conditions.

    Here are the available conditions for a custom app policy.

    |Condition|Condition values accepted|More information|
    |---|---|---|
    |App registration age|Within last X days||
    |Certification|No certification, Publisher attested, Microsoft 365 Certified|[Microsoft 365 Certification](/microsoft-365-app-certification/docs/enterprise-app-certification-guide)|
    |Publisher verified|Yes or No|[Publisher Verification](/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview)|
    |Permissions|Select one or more API permissions from list|[Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference)|
    |Delegated Permissions|Select one or more API permissions from list|[Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference)|
    |Highly privilege|Yes or No|This is an internal designation based on the same logic used by Defender for Cloud Apps.|
    |Overprivileged|Yes or No|Apps with more granted permissions than are being used by those apps.|
    |Non-Graph API permissions|Yes or No|Apps that have non-Graph API permissions.|
    |Data usage|Greater than X GB of data downloaded and uploaded per day||
    |Data usage trend|X % increase in data usage compared to previous day||
    |API access|Greater than X API calls per day||
    |API access trend|X % increase in API calls compared to previous day||
    |Number of consenting users|(Greater than or Less than) X consented users||
    |Increase in consenting users|X % increase in users in the last 90 days||
    |Priority account consent given|Yes or No|A user with a [priority account](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts).|
    |Names of consenting users|Select users from list||
    |Roles of consenting users|Select roles from list|Multiple selections allowed. <p> Any Azure AD role with assigned member should be made available in this list.|
    |Services accessed|Exchange and/or OneDrive and/or SharePoint and/or Teams|Multiple selections allowed.|
    |Error rate|Error rate is greater than X% in the last seven days||
    ||||

    All of the specified conditions must be met for this app policy to generate an alert.

1. When you're done specifying the conditions, select **Save**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Define Policy Actions** page, select **Disable app** if you want app governance to disable the app when an alert based on this policy is generated, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Define Policy Status** page, select one of these options:

    - **Audit mode**: Policies are evaluated but configured actions won't occur. Audit mode policies appear with the status of **Audit** in the list of policies.
    - **Active**: Policies are evaluated and configured actions will occur.
    - **Inactive**: Policies aren't evaluated and configured actions won't occur.

## Create a custom policy

App governance provides some basic templates that make it easy to create useful policies for monitoring apps in your tenant.

1. On the app governance page, select the **Policy** tab.
1. Select **Create policy**.
1. Under **Categories** select **Custom**. Under **Templates** select **Custom policy**. Select **Next**.
1. Enter a name for your policy, type a description, and then in the **Policy severity** drop-down list, select a severity. Select **Next**.
1. Select **No, I want to customize the policy** and then select **Next**.
1. Choose whether you want this policy to apply to all apps in your tenant or choose specific apps. If you choose specific apps for this policy, select **Add apps** and select the desired apps from the list. In the **Choose apps** pane, you can select multiple apps to which this policy will be applied, and then select **Add**. Select **Next** when you're satisfied with the list.
1. Select **Set new conditions for the policy** and then select **Edit conditions**. Select **Add condition** and choose a condition from the list and then select the condition to apply. Repeat to add more conditions. Select **Save** to save the rule, and when you're finished adding rules, select **Next**.
1. By default, this policy will trigger alerts when the conditions are met. You can choose to take action when the policy triggers such as **Disable app**. Use caution when applying actions because a policy may affect users and legitimate app use. Select **Next**.
1. Choose the policy status:
    - **Audit** - policy evaluation is active but policy action is disabled.
    - **Active** - policy evaluation and action are active.
    - **Inactive** - policy evaluation and action are disabled.

    You should use Audit mode for testing a new policy. Select **Next**.
1. Carefully review all parameters of your custom policy. Select **Submit** when you're satisfied. You can also go back and change settings by selecting **Edit** beneath any of the settings.

## Test and monitor your new app policy

Now that your app policy is created, you should monitor it on the **Policies** page to ensure it's registering an expected number of active alerts and total alerts during testing.

If the number of alerts is an unexpectedly low value, edit the settings of the app policy to ensure you've configured it correctly before setting its status.

Here's an example of a process for creating a new policy, testing it, and then making it active:

1. Create the new policy with severity, apps, conditions, and actions set to initial values and the status set to **Audit mode**.
2. Check for expected behavior, such as alerts generated.
3. If the behavior isn't expected, edit the policy apps, conditions, and action settings as needed and go back to step 2.
4. If the behavior is expected, edit the policy and change its status to **Active**.
