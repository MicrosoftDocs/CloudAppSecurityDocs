# Investigate behaviors with advanced hunting (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

While some of anomaly detections focus primarily on detecting problematic security scenarios, others can help identifying and investigating anomalous user behavior that may not necessarily indicate a compromise. For such detections, we created another data type called "behaviors", which is available in the Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting experience.

## Definition of a behavior

A behavior represents an abstraction above the raw data level that offers a deeper understanding of events, and is attached to MITRE attack categories and techniques. This level of data lies between raw events and alerts, and may be related to security scenarios, but is not necessarily a sign of malicious activity or a security incident. It's based on one or more raw events and provides contextual insights into what occurred at a specific point in time, using what the service has learned or identified.

This new data layer in Microsoft 365 Defender has been created to provide insights into these behaviors. This simplifies the investigation experience by showing what happened in the environment in a more descriptive way that includes MITRE tactics and techniques. Such activities can be events that weren't reflected in advanced hunting.

## Defender for Cloud Apps detections sent as behaviors

During the initial phase, behaviors will encompass low-fidelity detections from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps that may not meet the standard for alerts, however, they can still be useful in providing relevant context for an investigation.

The relevant detections are:

|Alert name  |Policy name  |
|---------|---------|
|Activity from infrequent country  |Activity from infrequent country   |
|Impossible travel activity  |Impossible travel  |
|Mass delete  |Unusual file deletion activity (by user)  |
|Mass download  |Unusual file download (by user)  |
|Mass share  |Unusual file share activity (by user)  |
|Multiple delete VM activities  |Multiple delete VM activities  |
|Multiple failed login attempts  |Multiple failed login attempts  |
|Multiple Power BI report sharing activities  |Multiple Power BI report sharing activities  |
|Multiple VM creation activities  |Multiple VM creation activities  |
|Suspicious administrative activity  |Unusual administrative activity (by user)  |
|Suspicious impersonated activity  |Unusual impersonated activity (by user)  |
|Suspicious OAuth app file download activities  |Suspicious OAuth app file download activities  |
|Suspicious Power BI report sharing  |Suspicious Power BI report sharing   |
|Unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth app  |Unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth app  |

## Transition from alerts to behaviors

To enhance the quality of alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and lower the number of false positives, we're developing a newly improved threat protection experience that transitions from *alerts* to *behaviors*. Our goal is to remove policies that give low-quality detections, while still creating security scenarios that focus on out-of-the-box detections. In parallel, we'll keep sending meaningful insights, in the form of *behaviors*, that can help with investigation scenarios.

The transition from alerts to behaviors includes the following phases:

1. Send behaviors in parallel to alerts. This phase is now completed.
1. **Currently in public preview**: By default, disable policies that generate behaviors so that they send *only* behaviors, and stop sending alerts.
1. Remove customer-facing policies completely, moving to a cloud-managed detection model that uses both custom detections and selected alerts generated by internal policies for high-fidelity, security-focused scenarios.

The transition also includes enhancements for supported behavior types and adjustments to policy-generated alerts for optimal accuracy.

> [!NOTE]
> The scheduling of the last phase is undetermined. Customers will be notified of any changes through notifications in the Message Center.

## Using behaviors in Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced hunting

Behaviors are now available in Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced hunting, and can be used by querying the behaviors tables, and by creating custom detection rules with them.

The behaviors schema in Advanced hunting is similar to the [alerts schema](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-alertinfo-table). The behaviors data is exposed in the following table:

|Table name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[BehaviorInfo](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-behaviorinfo-table) | Record per behavior with its metadata, including behavior title, MITRE Attack categories, and techniques. |
|[BehaviorEntities](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-behaviorentities-table) | Information on the entities that were part of the behavior. Can be multiple records per behavior.        |

To get complete information on a behavior and its entities, use `BehaviorId` as the primary key for the join:

```kusto
BehaviorInfo
| where BehaviorId == "INSERT VALUE"
| join BehaviorEntities on BehaviorId
```

**Example scenario 1**: You want to be alerted when a mass download is performed by a specific user or a list of users that are prone to be compromised or to internal risk. To do so, you can create the following query in Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced hunting:

```kusto
BehaviorEntities
| where ActionType == "MassDownload" 
| where EntityType == “User” and AccountName in (“username1”, “username2”…  ) 
```

And then you can create a custom detection rule based on the query. For more information on creating custom detection rules, see [Create and manage custom detection rules in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/custom-detection-rules).

**Example scenario 2**: You want to query 100 recent behaviors related to the MITRE attack technique **Valid Accounts (T1078)**:

```kusto
BehaviorInfo
| where AttackTechniques has "Valid Accounts (T1078)"
| order by Timestamp desc 
| take 100
```

**Example scenario 3**: Investigate all behaviors related to a specific user after understanding the user may have been compromised:

```kusto
BehaviorInfo
| where ServiceSource == "Microsoft Cloud App Security"
| where AccountUpn == "*username*"
| join BehaviorEntities on BehaviorId
| project Timestamp, BehaviorId, ActionType, Description, Categories, AttackTechniques, ServiceSource, AccountUpn, AccountObjectId, EntityType, EntityRole, RemoteIP, AccountName, AccountDomain, Application
```

**Example scenario 4**: Investigate all behaviors where one of the entities is a suspicious IP address:

```kusto
BehaviorEntities
| where EntityType == "Ip"
| where RemoteIP == "*suspicious IP*"
| where ServiceSource == "Microsoft Cloud App Security"
| project Timestamp, BehaviorId, ActionType, Categories, ServiceSource, AccountUpn, AccountObjectId, EntityType, EntityRole, RemoteIP, AccountName, AccountDomain
```

If you wish for some of the previous detections to appear as alerts, you can create custom detection rules in Advanced hunting to trigger alerts when specific behaviors occur with more control over the conditions per query.
