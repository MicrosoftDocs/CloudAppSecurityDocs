# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your GitHub Enterprise environment

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

GitHub Enterprise Cloud is a service that helps organizations store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. Along with the benefits of building and scaling code repositories in the cloud, your organization's most critical assets may be exposed to threats. Exposed assets include repositories with potentially sensitive information, collaboration and partnership details, and more. Preventing exposure of this data requires continuous monitoring to prevent any malicious actors or security-unaware insiders from exfiltrating sensitive information.

Connecting GitHub Enterprise Cloud to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities and provides threat detection for anomalous behavior.
