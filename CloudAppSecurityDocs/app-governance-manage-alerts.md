# Manage app governance alerts

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

You can investigate alerts about malicious cloud apps and apps that may present risks to your organization in the Microsoft 365 Defender **Alerts** or **Incidents** pages.

The **Alerts** page, by default lists new alerts generated by app governance based on threat detection rules and your active policies. View the details of a specific alert by selecting the alert. A page will open with additional information about the alert and options for managing the alert.

In the page, you can get additional information from the **Alert story** section:

- Exact details about why the alert was created under **What happened**
- Information on how to remediate the alert under **Recommended actions**

To investigate and take action on an app in app governance, select the app entity card under **Related entities** and then select **View app details**.

App policies that you configured for automatic remediation from the **Action** will have a status of **Resolved**.

To manage the app governance alert:

1. Investigation: Examine the information in the alert and change its status to **Mark in progress**.
2. Resolution: After your investigation and, as needed, the determination of app policy changes or continued app support in your tenant, change its status to **Resolved**.

Based on app alert patterns, you can update the appropriate app policy and change its **Action** setting to perform automatic remediation. This removes your need to investigate and manually resolve future alerts that are generated by the app policy. For more information, see [Manage your app policies](app-governance-app-policies-manage.md).
