# Alerts API

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

The Alerts API provides you with information about immediate risks identified by Defender for Cloud Apps that require attention. Alerts can result from suspicious usage patterns or from files containing content that violates company policy.

The following lists the supported requests:

- [List alerts](api-alerts-list.md)
- [Close benign](api-alerts-close-benign.md)
- [Close false positive](api-alerts-close-false-positive.md)
- [Close true positive](api-alerts-close-true-positive.md)
- [Fetch alert](api-alerts-fetch.md)
- [Mark alert as read](api-alerts-mark-read.md)
- [Mark alert as unread](api-alerts-mark-unread.md)

## Deprecated requests

The following table lists the requests deprecated as obsolete, and the requests that replace them.

| Obsolete request | Alternative |
| --- | --- |
| Bulk dismiss | [Close false positive](api-alerts-close-false-positive.md) |
| Bulk resolve | [Close true positive](api-alerts-close-true-positive.md) |
| Dismiss alert | [Close false positive](api-alerts-close-false-positive.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> The deprecated requests have been mapped to their alternatives to avoid disruption. However, if you are using obsolete requests in your environment, we recommend updating them to their alternatives.
