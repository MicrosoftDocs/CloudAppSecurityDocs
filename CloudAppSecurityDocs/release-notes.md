### Removing the ability to email end users about blocked actions

Effective October 1st, 2024, we will discontinue the feature that notifies end users via email when their action is blocked by session policies.

This option ensures that if a user's action is blocked, they get both a browser message and an email notification.

Admins can no longer configure this setting when creating new session policies.

Existing session policies with this setting will not trigger email notifications to end users when a block action occurs.

End users will continue to receive the block message directly through the browser and will stop receiving block notification via email.

For example:

![Screenshot of how to block notifying end user by email.](media/release-notes/notify-end-user-by-email.png)

## August 2024
