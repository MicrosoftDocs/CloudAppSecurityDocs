# Threat protection policies

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Defender for Cloud Apps enables you to identify high-risk use and cloud security issues, detect abnormal user behavior, and prevent threats in your sanctioned cloud apps. Get visibility into user and admin activities and define policies to automatically alert when suspicious behavior or specific activities that you consider risky are detected. Draw from the vast amount of Microsoft threat intelligence and security research data to help ensure that your sanctioned apps have all the security controls you need in place and help you maintain control over them.

> [!NOTE]
> When integrating Defender for Cloud Apps with Microsoft Defender for Identity, policies from Defender for Identity also appear on the policies page. For a list of Defender for Identity policies, see [Security Alerts](/defender-for-identity/suspicious-activity-guide).
