# Protect connected apps using cloud service provider APIs

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Defender for Cloud Apps provides end-to-end protection for connected apps using Cloud-to-Cloud integration, [API connectors](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md), and real-time access and session [controls leveraging our Conditional](proxy-intro-aad.md) App Access Controls.

Once an app is connected using one or more of these methods, you get instant out-of-the-box protection with our built-in anomaly detection engine. Additionally, you gain deep visibility into the app's user and device activities, control over data shared by the app, and can build detection policies with governance to mitigate any risky activities or sensitive-data sharing by the app.

The breadth of support for each app relies on the richness of its APIs. Use the following links to learn about how Defender for Cloud Apps protects connected apps and what risks those apps expose. For each app, review the list of available built-in anomaly detections, explore ready-to-use policy templates for monitoring and alerting on risky activities, use SSPM tools to view security misconfigurations, and discover which automated governance actions can be applied.

## SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)

Defender for Cloud App's SaaS SSPM features provide visibility into your SaaS app security configurations and security posture.

When a partner service with SSPM support is connected to Defender for Cloud Apps, the app's security configuration and posture is calculated into Microsoft Secure Score reports. Use the following procedures to connect apps with SSPM support and start seeing them included in Secure Score calculations and reports:

- [Citrix](connect-citrix-sharefile.md)
- [DocuSign](connect-docusign.md)
- [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](connect-github-ec.md)
- [Office 365](connect-office-365.md)
- [Okta](connect-okta.md)
- [ServiceNow](connect-servicenow.md)
- [Salesforce](connect-salesforce.md)
- [Zoom](connect-zoom.md)
