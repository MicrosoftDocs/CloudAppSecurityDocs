# Investigate threat detection alerts

App governance provides security detections and alerts for malicious activities. This article lists details for each alert that can aid your investigation and remediation, including the conditions for triggering alerts. Since threat detections are nondeterministic by nature, they're only triggered when there's behavior that deviates from the norm.

For more information, see [App governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](app-governance-manage-app-governance.md)

## MITRE ATT&CK

To make it easier to map the relationship between app governance alerts and the familiar MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, we've categorized the alerts by their corresponding MITRE ATT&CK tactic. This extra reference makes it easier to understand the suspected attacks technique potentially in use when app governance alert is triggered.

This guide provides information about investigating and remediating app governance alerts in the following categories.

- [Initial Access](#initial-access-alerts)
- Execution
- [Persistence](#persistence-alerts)
- [Privilege Escalation](#privilege-escalation-alerts)
- [Defense Evasion](#defense-evasion-alerts)
- Credential Access
- [Discovery](#discovery-alerts)
- Lateral Movement
- [Collection](#collection-alerts)
- [Exfiltration](#exfiltration-alerts)
- Impact

## Security alert classifications

Following proper investigation, all app governance alerts can be classified as one of the following activity types:

- **True positive (TP)**: An alert on a confirmed malicious activity.
- **Benign true positive (B-TP)**: An alert on suspicious but not malicious activity, such as a penetration test or other authorized suspicious action.
- **False positive (FP)**: An alert on a nonmalicious activity.

## General investigation steps

Use the following general guidelines when investigating any type of alert to gain a clearer understanding of the potential threat before applying the recommended action.

- Review the app severity level and compare with the rest of the apps in your tenant. This review helps you identify which Apps in your tenant pose the greater risk.
- If you identify a TP, review all the App activities to gain an understanding of the impact. For example, review the following App information:

  - Scopes granted access
  - Unusual behavior  
  - IP address and location

## Initial access alerts

This section describes alerts indicating that a malicious app may be attempting to maintain their foothold in your organization.  

### App redirects to phishing URL by exploiting OAuth redirection vulnerability

**Severity**: Medium

This detection identifies OAuth apps redirecting to phishing URLs by exploiting the response type parameter in OAuth implementation through the Microsoft Graph API.

**TP or FP?**

- **TP**: If you can confirm that the OAuth app was delivered from an unknown source, the response type of the reply URL after consenting to the OAuth app contains an invalid request, and redirects to an unknown or untrusted reply URL.  

  **Recommended action**: Disable and remove the app, reset the password, and remove the inbox rule.  

- **FP**: If after investigation, you can confirm that the app has a legitimate business use in the organization.

  **Recommended action**: Dismiss the alert.

**Understand the scope of the breach**

1. Review all activities done by the app.  
1. Review the scopes granted by the app.  

### OAuth App with suspicious Reply URL

**Severity**: Medium

This detection identifies an OAuth app accessed a suspicious Reply URL through the Microsoft Graph API.

**TP or FP?**

- **TP**: If you can confirm that the OAuth app is delivered from an unknown source, and redirects to a suspicious URL, then a true positive is indicated. A suspicious URL is one where the reputation of the URL is unknown, not trusted, or whose domain was recently registered and the app request is for a high privilege scope.

  **Recommended action**: Review the Reply URL, domains and scopes requested by the app. Based on your investigation, you can choose to ban access to this app. Review the level of permission requested by this app and which users are granted access.

  To ban access to the app, go to thee OAuth apps page. On the row in which the app you want to ban appears, select the ban icon. You can choose whether you want to tell users the app they installed and authorized has been banned. The notification lets users know the app will be disabled, and they won't have access to the connected app. If you don't want them to know, unselect **Notify users who granted access to this banned app** in the dialog. We recommend that you let the app users know their app is about to be banned from use.
