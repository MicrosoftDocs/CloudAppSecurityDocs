# Determine your app compliance posture

App governance allows you to quickly assess the compliance posture of Line of Business and third-party apps and their access to data in your Microsoft 365 tenant from the app governance Overview page in Microsoft 365 Defender.

From this page, you can see:

- For OAuth-enabled apps that use the Microsoft Graph API:

  - How many are in your tenant
  - How many might be overprivileged
  - How many are highly privileged

  From this information, you can determine the level of risk to your organization by overprivileged and highly privileged apps.

- For alerts:

  - How many active alerts your tenant has
  - How many are based on app governance detections (**Threat alerts**)
  - How many are based on app policies you have in place (**Policy alerts**)
  - The 10 latest alerts

  From this information, you can determine how quickly alerts are being generated and the relative number of detected and policy-based alerts.

- For data usage:

  - Total data accessed by apps in the tenant through Graph API over the current month and previous three calendar months. (Currently includes emails, files, and chat and channel messages read and written by apps that access Microsoft 365 using Graph API)
  - Data usage over the current month and previous three calendar months, broken down by resource type. (Currently includes emails, files, and chat and channel messages read and written by apps that access Microsoft 365 using Graph API)

  From this information, you can determine if there are anomalous spikes in data usage in your Microsoft 365 tenant.
