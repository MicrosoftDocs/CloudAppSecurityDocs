# Classic portal: Integrate with Microsoft Power Automate for custom alert automation

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Defender for Cloud Apps integrates with [Microsoft Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started) to provide custom alert automation and orchestration playbooks. By using the [connectors](/connectors/) available in Power Automate, you can automate the triggering of playbooks when Defender for Cloud Apps generates alerts. For example, automatically create an issue in ticketing systems using [ServiceNow connector](/connectors/service-now/) or send an approval email to execute a custom governance action when an alert is triggered in Defender for Cloud Apps.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a valid [Microsoft Power Automate plan](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/)

## How it works

On its own, Defender for Cloud Apps provides predefined governance options such as suspend a user or make a file private when defining policies. By creating a playbook in Power Automate using a Defender for Cloud Apps connector, you can create workflows to enable customized governance options for your policies. After the playbook is created in Power Automate, it will be automatically synchronized to Defender for Cloud Apps. Then associate it with a policy in Defender for Cloud Apps to send alerts to Power Automate. Microsoft Power Automate offers several connectors and conditions to create a customized workflow for your organization.

The [Defender for Cloud Apps connector](/connectors/cloudappsecurity/) in Power Automate supports automated triggers and actions. Power Automate is triggered automatically when Defender for Cloud Apps generates an alert. Actions include changing the alert status in Defender for Cloud Apps.

## Create Power Automate playbooks for Defender for Cloud Apps

1. [Create an API token](api-authentication.md) in Defender for Cloud Apps.

1. Navigate to the [Power Automate portal](https://flow.microsoft.com/), select **My flows**, select **New flow**, and in the drop-down, under **Build your own from blank**, select **Automated cloud flow**.
