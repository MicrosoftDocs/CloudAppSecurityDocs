In the coming weeks, we'll update the screenshots and instructions here and in related pages. For more information about the change, see [this announcement](https://aka.ms/defender-for-cloud-apps-Igniteblog).

>Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is now part of [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com). The Microsoft 365 Defender portal allows security admins to perform their security tasks in one location. This will simplify workflows, and add the functionality of the other >Microsoft 365 Defender services. Microsoft 365 Defender will be the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. For more information about these changes, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft 365 Defender](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-defender-cloud-apps?view=o365-worldwide&branch=pr-en-us-13898).
