# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Zendesk

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

As a customer service software solution, Zendesk holds the sensitive information to your organization. Any abuse of Zendesk by a malicious actor or any human error may expose your most critical assets and services to potential attacks.

Connecting Zendesk to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your Zendesk admin activities and provides threat detection for anomalous behavior.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats

- Data leakage

- Insufficient security awareness

- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

## How Defender for Cloud Apps helps to protect your environment

- [Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, and malicious insiders](best-practices.md#detect-cloud-threats-compromised-accounts-malicious-insiders-and-ransomware)

- [Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations](best-practices.md#use-the-audit-trail-of-activities-for-forensic-investigations)

## Control Zendesk with policies

| **Type**                           | **Name**                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in  anomaly detection policy | [Activity from   anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Activity from   infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country) <br /> [Activity from   suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)  <br /> [Activity   performed by terminated user](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-performed-by-terminated-user) (requires Azure Active Directory as IdP)   <br />[Multiple failed   login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)  <br /> [Unusual   administrative activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)<br />   [Unusual impersonated activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) |
| Activity  policy                   | Built a customized policy by the Zendesk audit log |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following Zendesk governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| **Type**        | **Action**                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User governance | Notify user on  alert (via Azure AD)<br />  Require user to sign in again (via Azure AD)   <br /> Suspend user (via Azure AD) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).
