# Basic setup for Defender for Cloud Apps



The following procedure gives you instructions for customizing your Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps environment.

## Prerequisites

For portal access requirements, see [Portal access](network-requirements.md#portal-access).

## Set up your Defender for Cloud Apps environment

1. In the Microsoft Defender Portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**.

1. Under **System** -> **Organization details**, it's important that you provide an **Organization display name** for your organization.

1. Provide an **Environment name** (tenant). This information is especially important if you manage more than one tenant.

1. (Optional) Upload a **Logo** file to be displayed in email notifications and web pages sent from the system. The logo must be a .PNG file with a maximum size of 150 x 50 pixels, on a transparent background.

   Logos are stored in publicly accessible storage. The source URL for your image is protected and stored internally. 

   Providing this image is voluntary, itâ€™s up to you to decide if you want to share this data with us. You can also choose to delete this image at anytime and it will be deleted from our storage. This decision does not affect the security of your organization or your users in any way.

1. Make sure you add a list of your **Managed domains** to identify internal users. Adding managed domains is a crucial step. Defender for Cloud Apps uses the managed domains to determine which users are internal, external, and where files should and shouldn't be shared. This information is used for reports and alerts.

    * Users in domains that aren't configured as internal are marked as external. External users aren't scanned for activities or files.

1. If you're integrating with Microsoft Purview Information Protection, see [Microsoft Purview Information Protection Integration](azip-integration.md) for information.

    * To work with Microsoft Purview Information Protection integration, you must enable the [App connector for Microsoft 365](./connect-office-365.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use ExpressRoute, Defender for Cloud Apps is deployed in Azure and fully integrated with [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction). All interactions with the Defender for Cloud Apps apps APIs and traffic sent to Defender for Cloud Apps APIs, including upload of discovery logs, is routed via ExpressRoute for improved latency, performance, and security.
>
> Microsoft Defender Portal usage is not included in the ExpressRoute integration.
