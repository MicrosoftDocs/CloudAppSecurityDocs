# Governing connected apps

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Governance enables you to control what your users do across apps. For connected apps, you can apply governance actions to files or activities. Governance actions are integrated actions you can run on files or activities directly from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Governance actions control what your users do across connected apps. For information about where you can use governance actions, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps attempts to run a governance action on a file but fails because the file is locked, it will automatically retry the governance action.

## File governance actions

The following governance actions can be taken for connected apps either on a specific file, user or from a specific policy.

- **Notifications:**

  - **Alerts** – Alerts can be triggered in the system and propagated via email, based on severity level.

  - **User email notification** – Email messages can be customized and will be sent to all violating file owners.

  - **Notify specific users** – Specific list of email addresses that will receive these notifications.

  - **Notify last file editor** – Send notifications to the last person who modified the file.

- **Governance actions in apps** - Granular actions can be enforced per app, specific actions vary depending on app terminology.

  - **Labeling**
    - **Apply label** - Ability to add a Microsoft Purview Information Protection sensitivity label.
    - **Remove label** - Ability to remove a Microsoft Purview Information Protection sensitivity label.
  - **Change sharing**

    - **Remove public sharing** – Allow access only to named collaborators, for example: *Remove public access* for Google Workspace, and *Remove direct shared link* for Box and Dropbox.

    - **Remove external users** – Allow access only to company users.

    - **Make private** – Only Site Admins can access the file, all shares are removed.

    - **Remove a collaborator** – Remove a specific collaborator from the file.

    - **Reduce public access** - Set Publicly available files to be available only with a shared link. (Google)

    - **Expire shared link** - Ability to set an expiration date for a shared link after which it will no longer be active. (Box)

    - **Change sharing link access level** - Ability to change the access level of the shared link between company only, collaborators only, and public. (Box)

    - **Put in user quarantine** – Allow self-service by moving the file to a user-controlled quarantine folder

    - **Put in admin quarantine** – File is moved to quarantine in the admin drive, and the admin has to approve it.

  - **Inherit permissions from parent** - This governance action enables you to remove specific permissions set for a file or folder in Office 365. Then revert to whatever permissions are set for the parent folder.

  - **Trash** – Move the file to the trash folder. (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, Cisco Webex)

> In SharePoint and OneDrive, Defender for Cloud Apps supports user quarantine only for files in Shared Documents libraries (SharePoint Online) and files in the Documents library (OneDrive for Business).
> 
> Microsoft Defender for Office 365 customers can control detected malware files in SharePoint and OneDrive via the [Microsoft 365 Defender **Quarantine** page](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine?viewid=Files). For example, supported activities include recovering files, deleting files, and downloading files in password-protected ZIP files. These activities are limited to files that were not already quarantined by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
> In SharePoint, Defender for Cloud Apps supports quarantine tasks only for files with Shared Documents in path in English.
> 
> Actions will only show for connected apps.

## Activity governance actions

- **Notifications**

  - **Alerts** – Alerts can be triggered in the system and propagated via email, based on severity level.

  - **User email notification** – Email messages can be customized and will be sent to all violating file owners.

  - **Notify additional users** – Specific list of email addresses that will receive these notifications.

- **Governance actions in apps** - Granular actions can be enforced per app, specific actions vary depending on app terminology.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is set to automatically sync with the users in your Active Directory on-premises environment the settings in the on-premises environment will override the Azure AD settings and this governance action will be reverted.

  - **Require user to sign in again** – Signs the user out and requires them to sign in again.

  - **Confirm user compromised** - Set the user's risk level to high. This causes the relevant policy actions defined in Azure AD to be enforced. For more information How Azure AD works with risk levels, see [How does Azure AD use my risk feedback](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback#how-does-azure-ad-use-my-risk-feedback).

## Revoke an OAuth app and notify user

For Google Workspace and Salesforce, it's possible to revoke permission to an OAuth app or to notify the user that they should change the permission. When you revoke permission it removes all permissions that were granted to the application under "Enterprise Applications" in Azure AD.

1. On the **Google** or **Salesforce** tabs on the **App governance** page, select the three dots at the end of the app row and select **Notify user**. By default, the user will be notified as follows: *You authorized the app to access your Google Workspace account. This app conflicts with your organization's security policy. Reconsider giving or revoking the permissions you gave this app in your Google Workspace account. To revoke app access, go to: <https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?hl=en&pli=1>  Select the app and select 'Revoke access' on the right menu bar.* You can customize the message that is sent.
2. You can also revoke permissions to use the app for the user. Select the icon at the end of the app row in the table and selecting **Revoke app**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/revoke-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example of the Revoke app option.":::


## Governance conflicts

After creating multiple policies, a situation may arise in which the governance actions in multiple policies overlap. In this case, Defender for Cloud Apps will process the governance actions as follows:

### Conflicts between policies

- If two policies contain actions that are contained on in each other (for example, **Remove external shares** is included in **Make private**), Defender for Cloud Apps will resolve the conflict and the stronger action will be enforced.
- If the actions are unrelated (for example, **Notify owner** and **Make private**). Both actions will take place.
- If the actions conflict (for example **Change owner to user A** and **Change owner to user B**), different results may result from every match. It's important to change your policies to prevent conflicts because they may result in unwanted changes in the drive that will be hard to detect.

### Conflicts in user sync

- If your Azure AD is set to automatically sync with the users in your Active Directory on-premises environment, the settings in the on-premises environment will override the Azure AD settings and this governance action will be reverted.

## Governance log

The Governance log provides a status record of each task that you set Defender for Cloud Apps to run, including both manual and automatic tasks. These tasks include those you set in policies, governance actions that you set on files and users, and any other action you set Defender for Cloud Apps to take. The Governance log also provides information about the success or failure of these actions. You can choose to retry or revert some of the governance actions from the Governance log.

To view the governance log, in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, under **Cloud Apps**, select **Governance log**.

The following table is the full list of actions the Defender for Cloud Apps portal enables you to take. These actions are enabled in various places throughout the console as described in the **Location** column. Each governance action taken is listed in the Governance Log.
For information about how governance actions are treated when there are policy conflicts, see [Policy Conflicts](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md).

| Location | Target object type | Governance action |Description| Related connectors|

This action will prevent access to any of the organization's data and will force the user to sign into all applications again.| Google Workspace, Office|
